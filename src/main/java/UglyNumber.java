public class UglyNumber {
    /*
        An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
        Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

        Example 1:

        Input: n = 6
        Output: true
        Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
        Example 2:

        Input: n = 1
        Output: true
        Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
        Example 3:

        Input: n = 14
        Output: false
        Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.


        Constraints:

        -231 <= n <= 231 - 1
